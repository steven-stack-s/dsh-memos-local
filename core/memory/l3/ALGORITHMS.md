# `core/memory/l3` — Algorithms

This note anchors the L3 implementation to the Reflect2Evolve V7 spec
(§1.1, §2.4.1, §4.3) and calls out the deviations we took for the
local-plugin runtime. Read alongside `README.md` for the high-level
contract.

---

## 1. Eligibility & gathering

**Input to `runL3`**: optional cluster hint; otherwise the orchestrator
scans all active L2 policies.

We only consider L2s that meet *all* of:

* `status = 'active'`  — candidates / retired policies never induce L3.
* `gain ≥ algorithm.l3Abstraction.minPolicyGain`.
* `support ≥ algorithm.l3Abstraction.minPolicySupport`.

The gain / support floors are deliberately low by default
(`minPolicyGain = 0.02`, `minPolicySupport = 1`,
`minPolicies = 2`). They exist to keep scratch-pad policies out of the
world-model picture, not as a primary gate — the primary gate is the
LLM itself, which can return `confidence = 0` and be filtered out.

> Default-tuning history: prior to 2026-04 these floors were `0.1` /
> `1` / `3` and the L3 layer effectively never fired in real usage
> because the original V7 contrast-only gain formula evaluates to ≈ 0
> on single-success-path corpora. The new shrinkage-anchored gain
> formula (see `core/memory/l2/gain.ts`) lifts genuinely-useful
> policies to the 0.05–0.2 band, so a 0.02 floor cleanly separates them
> from net-neutral noise.

## 2. Domain key extraction

```ts
domainKeyOf(policy) = primaryTag + "|" + secondaryTag
```

We derive tags via a stable, lowercase keyword sweep over
`procedure.preconditions`, `procedure.body`, and `trigger`:

```
docker|compose|kubernetes|k8s|alpine|ubuntu|debian
node|npm|pnpm|yarn|python|pip|poetry|conda
rust|cargo|go|java|maven|gradle|typescript|javascript
```

Matches are ordered by the first-hit position so the sweep is
deterministic, then we pick the top two distinct tokens. Newly induced L2
rows also persist trace-derived metadata (language, tags, tool names, error
codes, and the source signature); that structured metadata is preferred over
this legacy prose heuristic. We deliberately **do not** embed free-form LLM
tags here — domain keys must be cheap and stable enough to hash.

Policies with no recognised domain keyword fall into the generic bucket and
are only clustered when at least two vector-bearing policies pass the cosine
gate. This prevents unrelated no-label policies from becoming an L3 prompt.

---

## 3. Clustering

Spec (§2.4.1) expects a clustering step on "compatible sub-problems".
We implement a **two-stage bucket + two-mode admission** algorithm:

```
Stage 1 — bucket by domain key
    byKey: Map<string, PolicyWithMeta[]>

Stage 2 — admit a cohort from each bucket
    center = centroid(vectors_in_bucket)         // null if no vecs
    strict = []
    cohesion = mean cosine(member.vec, center) over the bucket
    for each member:
        if cosine(member.vec, center) ≥ θ_sim:   // config.clusterMinSimilarity
            strict.push(member)

    // Two-mode admission
    if |strict| ≥ θ_min:                          // config.minPolicies
        cohort     = strict
        admission  = "strict"
    elif |bucket| ≥ θ_min:
        cohort     = bucket          // fallback — domain key is enough
        admission  = "loose"
    else:
        skip

    emit cluster(cohort, admission, cohesion)
```

Rationale:

* Buckets give us **cheap, interpretable** groupings that match the way
  humans read the policies ("all the pip-on-alpine stuff").
* The strict centroid cutoff prevents two unrelated flavours of the
  same keyword (e.g. `python|pip` for data-sci vs `python|pip` for
  web-scraping) from being over-fused.
* The **loose fallback** (added 2026-04) recognises that real LLM-
  generated policy titles often drift in embedding space even when
  they belong to the same project / sub-problem family — e.g. one
  policy is "validate python syntax" and another is "register CLI
  subcommand", both legitimately under `python|_`. Without the
  fallback, every demo / short-window usage would discard the bucket
  outright; with it, we still surface a world model and let
  `abstract.ts` dampen confidence based on the reported `cohesion`
  score.

`avgGain` on each cluster is the mean `gain` of its surviving members.
`cohesion ∈ [0, 1]` is the mean cosine of the bucket against the
centroid (computed before admission, so it reflects raw bucket spread).
Final ordering combines both: `avgGain × (0.5 + 0.5 · cohesion)` so
strict, high-gain clusters surface first.

`abstract.ts` uses `admission` + `cohesion` to:

* dampen the persisted `confidence` of `loose` clusters (down to 0.6×
  for cohesion = 0; pass-through for `strict`),
* expose them in the LLM prompt header as
  `ADMISSION: <strict|loose> (cohesion=<n>)` so the model can widen
  the world model's `environment` / `inference` scope when the cluster
  is loose rather than over-fitting to a single policy's wording.

---

## 4. Evidence packing

Per cluster we assemble one or more prompt payloads. Policies are sorted
deterministically and split into batches of at most
`maxPoliciesPerCluster`; the limit bounds prompt size and never discards
cluster members. Batch drafts are then unioned into one draft before the
single merge/create decision.

```
{
  primary_tag: string,
  domain_tags: string[],
  avg_gain: number,
  avg_support: number,
  policies: PolicyPrompt[],     // up to maxPoliciesPerCluster, each capped
  evidence:  TracePrompt[]      // at most traceEvidencePerPolicy × batch size
}
```

* Each policy is serialised `id | title | trigger | procedure | rationale`
  truncated to `policyCharCap` characters.
* For each policy we fetch the most recent non-redacted supporting
  trace (by `episodeId`) and include up to `traceCharCap` characters of
  `userText + reflection`. Evidence is **read-only**, never mutated.
* Per-call token budget is bounded by `policyCharCap × batchSize +
  traceCharCap × evidencePerPolicy × batchSize`, which is deterministic
  and easy to debug.

---

## 5. LLM abstraction (`l3.abstraction` prompt)

Prompt id `l3.abstraction` (see `core/llm/prompts/l3-abstraction.ts`).
The system message makes three contracts explicit:

1. Output MUST be a JSON object. We wrap with `completeJson` so a
   parse failure is auto-retried once by the LLM adapter.
2. The keys `environment`, `inference`, `constraints` are required —
   each is an array of `{ label, description, evidenceIds[] }`.
3. `body` is a rendered markdown summary; `confidence ∈ [0, 1]`;
   `supersedes_world_ids` is optional.

`normaliseDraft` coerces any loose LLM output into a strict `L3AbstractionDraft`:

* Strips non-string evidence ids and non-object entries.
* Uses `title || "<generated>"` and `body || ""` so we never persist
  `undefined`.
* Clamps confidence into `[0, 1]`.
* Deduplicates `domain_tags` and lowercases them.

On LLM failure we return `{ ok: false, skippedReason }` — the cluster
is dropped for the current run, logged, and the cooldown is **not**
set, so the cluster will be retried next trigger.

---

## 6. Merge vs create

Given a cluster and its draft:

```
candidates = gatherMergeCandidates(cluster, draft)   // findByDomainTag + supersedes lookup
if draft.supersedesWorldIds contains an existing WM:
    return { kind: "update", target: explicit, cosine: 1 }
if cluster.centroidVec is null:
    return { kind: "create" }

best = argmax over candidates of cosine(centroidVec, wm.vec)
if best.cosine ≥ clusterMinSimilarity:
    return { kind: "update", target: best.row, cosine: best.cosine }
return { kind: "create" }
```

`mergeForUpdate` then unions the structured arrays:

```
patch.structure = {
    environment: dedupeByLabel(existing.environment ∪ draft.environment),
    inference:   dedupeByLabel(existing.inference   ∪ draft.inference),
    constraints: dedupeByLabel(existing.constraints ∪ draft.constraints),
}
patch.domainTags       = dedupe(existing.domainTags ∪ draft.domainTags)
patch.policyIds        = dedupe(existing.policyIds ∪ cluster.policyIds)
patch.sourceEpisodeIds = dedupe(existing.sourceEpisodeIds ∪ cluster.episodeIds)
patch.confidence       = clamp(existing.confidence + confidenceDelta, 0, 1)
patch.body             = draft.body  (LLM rewrite is authoritative)
patch.inducedBy        = "l3.merge"
```

Dedupe uses normalised labels (`trim().toLowerCase()`) so small
whitespace / casing differences fold in.

## 7. Confidence updates

Confidence is the single scalar Tier-3 retrieval and the viewer rank
on. It moves along three axes:

| Event                              | Delta                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| New WM inserted                    | `clamp(draft.confidence, 0, 1)`        |
| Merge into existing WM             | `+algorithm.l3Abstraction.confidenceDelta` |
| Human thumbs-up                    | `+confidenceDelta`                     |
| Human thumbs-down                  | `−confidenceDelta`                     |
| LLM-driven supersedes              | target WM retains `existing.confidence + delta`; the superseded WM's `inducedBy` is marked `l3.superseded` |

All changes are logged on `core.memory.l3.confidence` (LLM driven) or
`core.memory.l3.feedback` (human driven) with `{ previous, next }` for
audit.

---

## 8. Cooldown

Runs are expensive (LLM-bound). We debounce per-cluster via the `kv`
table:

```
key = `l3.lastRun.${cluster.primaryTag}`
if (now − kv.get(key)) < cooldownDays × 86_400_000:
    skip cluster, emit l3.abstraction.started with skippedReason="cooldown"
```

`cooldownDays = 0` disables this entirely (used by tests).

---

## 9. Failure policy

* Storage error → warn for the affected cluster and retain retry state.
  Other clusters continue; a later run re-drives the failed cluster.
* LLM error → single-cluster skip, reason logged. No cooldown update.

Failed LLM drafts use a persisted retry key scoped by cluster membership. The
retry delays are 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours, then 6 hours (capped), so a
repeated provider failure cannot consume one LLM call per episode. A successful
world-model insert/update clears the retry key and only then records the normal
cooldown. Storage failures keep the retry state and do not record success.
  Other clusters continue.
* Invalid draft (missing `environment/inference/constraints`) →
  treated as LLM error.
* Subscriber throws on `l2.policy.induced` → bus catches and logs to
  `core.memory.l3.events.listener_threw`; never crashes L2.

---

## 10. Retrieval integration

Tier-3 retrieval (`core/retrieval/tier3.ts`) takes every L3 row with
`confidence ≥ minConfidenceForRetrieval` and ranks them by:

```
score(wm) = α · cosine(query, wm.vec) + β · wm.confidence
          − γ · staleness(wm.updatedAt)
```

See `core/retrieval/ALGORITHMS.md` for the ranking details. The L3
module itself does **not** know about retrieval; it only writes the
data that retrieval consumes.
