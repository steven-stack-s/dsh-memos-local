# Advanced configuration

The default `config.yaml` shipped by `install.sh` only exposes the handful of
fields a user is likely to care about (viewer port, embedding/LLM provider,
hub, telemetry, log level). Everything else is controlled by baked-in
defaults that match the V7 algorithm spec.

If you need to override any of these, just add the corresponding block to
`config.yaml`. The writer preserves comments and field order, so partial
overrides are safe.

## What's hidden from the default template (but still honored if you add it)

### `viewer`
```yaml
viewer:
  port: 18910
  bindHost: 127.0.0.1       # do NOT change unless you know why
  openOnFirstTurn: false
```

### `bridge`
```yaml
bridge:
  port: 18911
  mode: stdio               # stdio | tcp
```

### `embedding`
```yaml
embedding:
  endpoint: ""              # override cloud provider base URL
  model: "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  dimensions: 384
  cache:
    enabled: true
    maxItems: 20000
```

### `llm`
```yaml
llm:
  endpoint: ""              # override provider base URL
  temperature: 0
  fallbackToHost: true      # retry through the OpenClaw host LLM on failure
  timeoutMs: 45000
  maxRetries: 3
```

### `storage`
```yaml
storage:
  ftsTokenizer: trigram      # trigram | cjk
```

`trigram` preserves the historical FTS5 behavior. `cjk` keeps short Chinese
words and mixed ASCII+CJK terms searchable in the keyword channel, which helps
queries such as `早报`, `配置`, and `API配置`.

For OpenRouter-backed OpenAI-compatible models, you can ask OpenRouter to
skip providers that are unreliable for reflection/scoring prompts:

```yaml
llm:
  provider: openai_compatible
  endpoint: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
  model: google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite
  apiKey: sk-or-v1-...
  providerIgnore:
    - together
    - deepinfra
    - novita
  # providerOrder:
  #   - google
  #   - anthropic
  #   - openai
```

The same `providerIgnore` and `providerOrder` fields are accepted on
`skillEvolver`, `l3Llm`, and `embedding` config blocks.
They map to OpenRouter's `provider.ignore` and `provider.order` request
fields and are omitted when empty or when the endpoint is not OpenRouter.
OpenRouter is detected from the normalized `openrouter.ai` hostname. For a
reverse proxy or CNAME, set `openRouter: true` on that config block to opt in.

### `algorithm`
Direct mapping to the V7 spec (γ, support, gain, top-K, etc.). Change only
if you know what you're doing — defaults are calibrated for the paper.

> **2026-04 default-tuning note** — the L2/L3/Skill thresholds shipped in
> the V7 paper (`minGain=0.1`, `minPolicies=3`, `candidateTrials=5`)
> turned out to be too strict for normal interactive usage: real users
> almost never produce explicit failure cohorts, so the V7 contrast-only
> gain formula `G = mean(V_with) − mean(V_without)` collapses to ≈ 0 and

>    neutral 0.5 prior (Beta-binomial shrinkage, pseudocount 5). Useful

>    of ≈ 0; net-neutral / harmful policies stay at ≤ 0 and are
>    archived as before.
> 2. The L3 / Skill floors below were lowered to match the new gain
>    distribution: `minGain` 0.1 → 0.02, `minPolicies` 3 → 2,
>    `candidateTrials` 5 → 3, `minTraceValue` 0.05 → 0.01.
>
> Together these let a focused user reach an L3 world model + first
> graduated Skill within ~1 week of normal usage instead of essentially
> never.

#### Tuning cheat-sheet

| Symptom                                              | Try                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Packet dominated by old, off-topic traces            | Lower `weightPriority`, raise `minTraceSim`.                 |
| Similar traces keep repeating in packet              | Lower `mmrLambda` (0.5–0.6) for more diversity.              |
| Tag filter suppresses legitimate results             | Keep `tagFilter: auto` (fallback kicks in) or set `"off"`.   |
| Too few skills surface after restart / fresh install | Lower `minSkillEta` (0.3); skills start at η=0.5 by default. |
| Ranker too slow in perf logs                         | Lower `candidatePoolFactor` (e.g. 3).                        |
| L2 induction fires on single-episode loops (noisy)   | Raise `l2Induction.minEpisodesForInduction` (e.g. 3).        |
| Useful L2 policies never get promoted to `active`    | Lower `algorithm.skill.minGain` or `minSupport`.             |
| LLM costs too high during heavy on-ramp              | Set `l2Induction.useLlm: false` — candidates still collect.  |
| Active policies churn between `active` ↔ `archived`  | Lower `l2Induction.archiveGain` (-0.10 for a wider dead-zone).|
| L3 world models never get created                    | Confirm at least 2 policies are `active` and share a domain key; lower `l3Abstraction.clusterMinSimilarity` (0.5–0.55) if the domain is heterogeneous. |
| Too many near-duplicate world models                 | Raise `l3Abstraction.clusterMinSimilarity` (0.65–0.7).         |
| Low-confidence world models leak into retrieval      | Raise `l3Abstraction.minConfidenceForRetrieval`.                |
| Skills never graduate from `candidate`               | Lower `skill.candidateTrials` (e.g. 2) or `minEtaForRetrieval` (e.g. 0.4). |
| Skills churn between `active` ↔ `archived`           | Lower `skill.archiveEta` (0.15) or raise `etaDelta` damping.    |
| Verifier rejects most drafts with "coverage-low"     | Raise `skill.traceCharCap`/`evidenceLimit` so more evidence reaches the verifier. |
| Verifier rejects drafts with "resonance-low"         | Confirm CJK tokenization is enabled (verifier supports CJK bigrams since 2026-04); otherwise lower the implicit minResonance. |
| Too few skills surface — retrieval empty             | Lower `skill.minSupport` (1) or `minGain` (0.0).                |
| Agent ignores obvious failure loops (≥3 tries)       | Lower `feedback.failureThreshold` (2) or `failureWindow` (3).   |
| "value-delta-low" keeps skipping valid repairs       | Lower `feedback.valueDelta` (0.3) — it's the §2.4.6 δ floor.    |
| Decision-repair table fills with near-duplicates     | Raise `feedback.cooldownMs` (e.g. 300000 = 5 min).              |
| Repair guidance never reaches skills                 | Check `feedback.attachToPolicy: true` and that the source      |
|                                                      |   policies are `active`; only active policies get tagged.       |
| Template-only repairs feel generic                   | Set `feedback.useLlm: true` and confirm the LLM provider works. |

## Resetting to defaults

Delete the block in `config.yaml`. On next load the schema's default value
kicks in.

## Environment-variable overrides (dev/test only)

| Env var             | Effect                                                        |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MEMOS_HOME`        | Overrides the whole runtime home. All paths recomputed from it. |
| `MEMOS_CONFIG_FILE` | Overrides only the config file path.                          |

These are intentionally undocumented in user-facing docs — they're meant for
tests and CI, not day-to-day configuration.
