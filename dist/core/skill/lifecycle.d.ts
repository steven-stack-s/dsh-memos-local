/**
 * V7 §2.5.4 — Skill lifecycle.
 *
 * A skill moves through three visible states: `candidate`, `active`,
 * `archived`. Transitions are driven by:
 *
 *   - **Trials**: `trialsAttempted` grows on every `trial.pass` / `trial.fail`
 *     feedback signal. Once `trialsAttempted >= candidateTrials` we check
 *     the success ratio + η and promote to `active` or bounce back.
 *   - **Reward**: `reward.updated` on the source policy bubbles into
 *     `recomputeEta`, which re-seeds η from the policy's updated gain.
 *   - **User thumbs**: direct `user.positive` / `user.negative` signals
 *     adjust η by `etaDelta`.
 *
 * Everything here is pure over a `SkillRow`. The orchestrator calls these
 * helpers inside a `tx` so updates are atomic and auditable.
