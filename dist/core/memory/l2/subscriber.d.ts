/**
 * `attachL2Subscriber` — bridge between the reward pipeline and the L2
 * orchestrator.
 *
 * On every `reward.updated` event:
 *   1. Reload the episode's traces (reward.updated only tells us the ids;
 *      we need full rows with fresh V values).
 *   2. Call `runL2` with the pre-wired deps.
 *   3. Surface errors as `l2.failed` on the L2 bus; never throw upstream.
 *
 * Keeping this as an explicit subscriber (rather than shoving it inside the
 * reward runner) means L2 failures never roll back reward writes and we can
 * unit-test the whole pipeline by emitting a fake `reward.updated` event.
