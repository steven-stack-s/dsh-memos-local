/**
 * Policy gain bookkeeping (V7 §0.6 eq. 4 / §2.4.5 row ③) with a
 * **shrinkage-anchored** baseline.
 *
 *   G(f²) = mean(V_with) − blendedWithoutMean
 *
 *   blendedWithoutMean
 *     = (mean(V_without)·n_without + V7_NEUTRAL·N₀) / (n_without + N₀)
 *
 * Where:
 *   - V7_NEUTRAL = 0.5 — the V7 §0.6 scoring rubric anchors a neutral /
 *     "no signal" reward at this value (R_human is in [-1, 1]; backprop'd
 *     V values for typical successful turns sit at 0.5–0.85, neutral
 *     baseline at 0.5, failures at < 0.5 down to negative).
 *   - N₀ = 5 — pseudocount weight of the prior, expressed in "virtual
 *     without-samples". With N₀ = 5 a policy needs ≥ 5 real comparable
 *     traces before the empirical without-mean fully overrides the prior.
 *
 * **Why shrinkage?** The original V7 formula `G = mean(V_with) −
 * mean(V_without)` assumes the training corpus contains failure cohorts
 * that drag `mean(V_without)` below `mean(V_with)`. In real interactive
 * usage:
 *
 *   1. Almost every episode is graded as a success (R_human ≈ 0.6–0.85).
 *   2. The reward backprop spreads similar V values across all step
 *      traces, so without-set traces (other episodes) end up at the same
 *      0.5–0.7 band as with-set traces.
 *   3. The empirical difference collapses to ≈ 0 by construction, no
 *      matter how genuinely useful the policy is.
 *
 * Anchoring the without-set against a neutral 0.5 prior fixes this:
 *
 *   - A policy whose with-set lives at V ≈ 0.8 now scores G ≈ 0.3 even
 *     when no failure-cohort exists (the neutral baseline guarantees a
 *     positive lift for genuinely-useful policies).
 *   - A policy whose with-set is mediocre (V ≈ 0.5) still scores G ≈ 0
 *     and stays in `candidate`.
 *   - A truly harmful policy (with-set V < 0.5) goes negative and is
 *     archived by `archiveGain` (-0.05 default).
 *   - As real comparable evidence accumulates, the prior gracefully
 *     dilutes and we recover the V7 §0.6 contrast formulation.
 *
 * We use **value-weighted** mean for the with-set (softmax(V/τ)), as V7
 * specifies — this prevents a single outlier failure from tanking the
 * positive set. The without-set keeps an arithmetic mean (its variance
 * is itself signal).
