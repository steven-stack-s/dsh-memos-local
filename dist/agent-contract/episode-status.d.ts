 * `active | completed | skipped | failed`. Without a shared source of

 * leaves rows the client renders as "completed" — so this module is
 * the single derivation point.
 *
 * Keep this file framework-free: it's imported by the Vite-bundled
 * viewer, the Node HTTP server, and unit tests. No DOM, no Node
 * built-ins.
